# ðŸ§ª Testing Guide for Maven SSO Package Development

This guide covers testing during **package development**. For end-user testing, see the generated README after running the scaffold command.

## ðŸš€ Quick Package Testing

```bash
# 1. Build the package
npm run build

# 2. Run unit tests
npm run test:netlify

# 3. Test with Netlify dev (optional)
npm run dev:netlify
```

## ðŸ“‹ Testing Methods

### 1. **Unit Tests** (Primary for Package Development)
Tests the handler functions directly without HTTP layer.

```bash
npm run test:netlify
```

**What it tests:**
- âœ… CORS headers
- âœ… HTTP method validation  
- âœ… Input validation
- âœ… Error handling
- âœ… Origin validation
- âœ… Cookie handling

### 2. **Integration Testing** (For Package Validation)
Test the actual handlers in a Netlify environment:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start dev server
npm run dev:netlify

# Terminal 2: Run integration tests  
npm run test:curl
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Test Results

### âœ… Unit Test Results
All tests should pass:
```
ðŸš€ Starting Maven SSO Netlify Functions Tests

ðŸ§ª Testing CORS (OPTIONS requests)...
âœ… Login CORS: PASS
âœ… Logout CORS: PASS
âœ… CheckAuth CORS: PASS

ðŸ§ª Testing HTTP method validation...
âœ… Login rejects GET: PASS
âœ… Logout rejects POST: PASS
âœ… CheckAuth rejects POST: PASS

ðŸ§ª Testing login validation...
âœ… Login rejects missing code: PASS
âœ… Login accepts code: PASS

ðŸ§ª Testing check auth without token...
âœ… CheckAuth without token: PASS

ðŸ§ª Testing logout...
âœ… Logout success: PASS
âœ… Logout clears cookie: PASS

ðŸ§ª Testing origin validation...
âœ… Rejects bad origin: PASS
âœ… Accepts good origin: PASS

âœ¨ Tests completed!
```

## ðŸ”§ Package Development Workflow

1. **Make changes to handlers** in `src/netlify/createHandlers.ts`
2. **Build the package:** `npm run build`
3. **Run unit tests:** `npm run test:netlify`
4. **Test integration** (if needed): `npm run dev:netlify`

## ðŸš€ Testing the CLI Scaffold

Test that the scaffold command works correctly:

```bash
# Build the package
npm run build

# Test in a temporary directory
mkdir /tmp/test-scaffold
cd /tmp/test-scaffold

# Run the scaffold command
npx /path/to/your/package scaffold

# Verify files were created
ls -la
# Should see: netlify/, .env.example, netlify.toml, README.md
```

## ðŸ“¦ Package Publishing Checklist

Before publishing to npm:

- [ ] All unit tests pass (`npm run test:netlify`)
- [ ] Package builds successfully (`npm run build`)
- [ ] CLI scaffold works (`test in temp directory`)
- [ ] TypeScript types are generated (`dist/` contains .d.ts files)
- [ ] Environment examples are comprehensive
- [ ] Documentation is up to date

## ðŸ†˜ Common Development Issues

### Build Errors
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf dist/
npm run build
```

### Test Failures
- Check if handlers are properly exported
- Verify mock event structure matches Netlify format
- Ensure CORS configuration is correct

### CLI Issues
- Make sure `dist/cli/scaffold.js` is executable
- Check that all template files are included
- Verify file paths in scaffold script

*Keep it simple for package development!* ðŸŽ¯ The heavy testing is for end-users of your package.
